## Hello
My name is Yudistira Firman Syah. I am a backend PHP web developer, but I can also do full-stack development. I have 2 years experience in web-development. My current interest is JavaScript web development, because in my previous positions I needed to use PHP based framework. I also currently learning about advanced front-end development.

PHP is my favorite for creating APIs, especially using Laravel framework. For front-end, I've used blade, ejs, and vue so far. I can also do integration with external API in your website.

I am currently open for remote or local job opportunities and freelance works.
